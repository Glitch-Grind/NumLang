# NumLang 1.0

A simple programming language designed for mathematical computations with a **canvas-based IDE** featuring syntax highlighting and live execution.

---

## 📋 About

NumLang is a minimal programming language focused on mathematical expressions and calculations. This repository contains a fully-functional web-based IDE built with HTML5 Canvas and Python, allowing you to write and execute NumLang scripts directly in your browser.

## 🎯 Language Features

### Variables
Declare variables using the `let` keyword:
```numlang
let x = 10
let y = 5.5
let result = x + y
```

### Output
Print values using the `print` keyword:
```numlang
print 42
print x + y
print sqrt(16)
```

### Mathematical Functions
Built-in math functions:
- `sqrt(x)` - Square root
- `sin(x)` - Sine (radians)
- `cos(x)` - Cosine (radians)
- `tan(x)` - Tangent (radians)
- `log(x)` - Natural logarithm

### Mathematical Constants
- `pi` - π (3.14159...)
- `e` - Euler's number (2.71828...)

### Operators
- `+` - Addition
- `-` - Subtraction
- `*` - Multiplication
- `/` - Division
- `^` - Exponentiation (power)
- `()` - Parentheses for grouping

### Comments
Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments:
```numlang
# This is a comment
let x = 10  # Inline comment
```

### Example Program
```numlang
# Calculate the area of a circle
let radius = 5
let area = pi * radius^2
print area

# Use trigonometric functions
let angle = pi / 4
print sin(angle)
print cos(angle)
```
